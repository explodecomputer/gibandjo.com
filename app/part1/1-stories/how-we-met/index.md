		<h2 class="righttext">The story according to the groom</h2>
		
		<p class="righttext"> <img src="/img/gibhux.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 10px;">Once upon a time, far away in a magical kingdom (Scotland), that was ruled by a brave and fearless leader (Mel Gibson), but oppressed by vicious and thieving neighbours (England), there was an enchanted research institute (we shall call it the "Roslin Institute"), where all things glowed (GFP) and the hushed voices of scientists filled the corridors with contentment and wisdom (this part is true).</p>

		<p class="righttext">Meanwhile in Kenya, another group of busy scientists were bothering some of the local goats. But immigration bureaucrats were getting restless because they needed some important stamps. So one day one of the goat botherers, Josephine, embarked upon a dangerous voyage to the enchanted research institute where, it was said, many important stamps could be obtained.</p>

		<p class="righttext">In a small office in a forgotten corner of the enchanted research institute sat a young and brilliant scientist. Nearby was the (often vacant) desk of a PhD student called Gibran. He rarely came to the enchanted research institute because, as it so happened, he was storing all the important stamps in his flat. And he would spend every day looking at them with glee. </p>

		<p class="righttext">When Josephine arrived at the enchanted research institute, she was allocated a desk directly behind Gibran's desk. Historians are divided on whether or not this was a coincidence. For completely unrelated reasons, Gibran started coming in to his office much more regularly at this point.</p>

		<p class="righttext">Soon they became friends, and Gibran began to trust Josephine. To impress her, he began bringing her gifts in the form of the important stamps. Josephine was pleased by this, and she gladly accepted them until she had accumulated enough to take back to the immigration bureaucrats in Kenya, and continue her life long work of bothering goats in deserts.</p>

		<p class="righttext">In the months and years following, Josephine and Gibran managed to single handedly keep the airline industry in profit through their global quest for goats and stamps. They are now in Bristol, lying in wait to unleash their goats and stamps upon the world.</p>

		<h2>The story according to the bride</h2>
		
		<p><img src="/img/johux.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;">Once upon a time in a rural part of Scotland, some scientists decided to create a research institute where they could make lots of things glow. This research institute was the home of much weeping and gnashing of teeth by PhD students, which is why Gibran almost always worked from the relative safety of his bed.</p>

		<p>One fateful day, Josephine arrived to begin a month of weeping and teeth gnashing in order to split up her time living in Kenya on a tourist visa. She was shown to her desk in a nearly empty office and told that, if he ever showed up, someone named Gib was the guy to ask about fun things to do in Edinburgh. This would turn out to be a good conversation starter, and the conversation rarely stopped after that. In fact, for this month, Gib's colleagues were surprised to see him in the office so much, but he got very little done.</p>

		<p>Some months later, after Josephine moved back from Kenya, Gibran and Josephine reunited in Manchester and also Stockholm, because by chance they were both going to those places at the same time. During these eventful days they ate hummus under a tram bridge to escape the Manchester rain, enjoyed the music of the Ukelele Orchestra of Great Britain in Macclesfield with Gib's little sister, and wandered aimlessly across Stockholm's bridges before taking the most expensive taxi ride in the world. The cost of this taxi ride to the train station where they were to separate somehow was still not enough money or travel for the relationship. </p>

		<p>Even more months later, Gib traveled all the way to the rolling lentil fields of Pullman, Washington (braving US immigration) to visit Jo. This was the first of many long haul flights that would lead to the extremely high carbon footprint of the relationship... because then, Gib moved to Australia.</p>

		<p>Josephine decided local lentils were just not enough for her, and went to stay with Gibran in Australia, but only after hanging out in South Africa for a while to make sure he really missed her.</p>
