		<p>Josephine’s parents, Naomi Grobstein and Peter Walker, have lived in Montclair, New Jersey since 1981.</p>

		<p>Naomi was born and brought up in New Jersey, living her entire life there with the exception of her time at university. For a change of scene she left her rural college in Ohio for a year at Leeds University. There she met a nice young man who was organizing a canal holiday for some other students, and having nowhere else to go during the holidays, she decided to join in. She did not imagine at the time that this was to be the first of more than 50 canal trips that she would take part in, as he hasn't stopped organizing and he is now her husband of 36 years. She also hadn't expected that two of their three children would make England their home.</p>

		<p>Peter was born and brought up in Farnborough, Hampshire.  Peter moved to New Jersey and they were married in 1978, while Naomi was a medical student.   Naomi has had a medical practice in Montclair since 1983, and Peter, after working in IT and management for a health insurance company, is now enjoying retirement and part-time consulting.</p>

		<p>Jo’s older sister, Liz (Elizabeth Kasper), a health care policy consultant, and her husband Andrew live with their two young children in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Jo’s older brother Derek and his wife Anna live in Oxford, where he manages the rare books department of Blackwell's Bookshop.</p>

		<h2>Family background</h2>
		
		<p>One of Jo's maternal great grandparents was born in New York City, and the other three came to NYC from Eastern Europe in the early 1900's when times were hard for Jews. Jo's great grandmother who was born in New York had parents who had also come from Eastern Europe a generation before.</p>

		<p>Jo's maternal grandfather lived all his life in New Jersey with the exception of his time in the Navy. Her maternal grandmother, a retired school nurse and civic leader, lived in New York briefly as a child then never lived out of New Jersey. Her uncle Dan lives in Linden, NJ, and her aunt Sherry lives in Massachusetts.</p>

		<p>Peter’s father was a spaceflight researcher, known in that field for the “Walker Constellation” of satellite orbits.  Peter’s mother was an Orthoptist in the National Health Service who helped write the classic textbook for that profession. Peter’s brother, David, lives in Beeston, Notts. Peter’s parents moved to Urmston in 2005, to be closer to his sister Maggie and her partner Margaret, but unfortunately passed away before having an opportunity to meet the Hemani family. </p>
