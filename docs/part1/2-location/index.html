<h2>Lower Damgate Farm</h2>

<p>The venue is comprised of a converted barn and stunning renovated cottages dating back to the 16th Century. The farm is situated in the Peak District and home, not just to humans, but rescued animals like chickens, goats and alpacas. </p>

<p>The area has very little telephone network connectivity so it&#39;s likely that our mobile phones won&#39;t work. We are providing the farm&#39;s landline number just in case you wish to get into contact or need directions, however, please only use this number on the day of the wedding. </p>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>

<p>Please note that car parking space is limited, so if you plan to drive to the farm on Saturday please let us know so that we can make arrangements.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is to lookup the directions on Google. (Click on the &quot;pin&quot; in the center of the map above, then on &quot;directions&quot; and enter your starting point). <strong>Print the directions</strong> as the area around the farm has very little phone signal.</p>

<p>Using sat nav directions to the post code DE6 2AD may result in directions that take you to the tiny village of Stanshope. You will know you are there if you see a sign at a gateway for Stanshope Hall Bed and Breakfast.</p>

<p>Lower Damsgate Farm is 0.6 miles south of Stanshope Hall via Ilam Moor Road in the direction of Ilam. Look for two farms directly opposite from each other with a large sycamore tree outside. Lower Damsgate is on your left if coming from Stanshope, on the right if coming from Ilam. There is a sign outside the gate featuring Cedric the sheep.</p>

<p>In case it is of any help the following directions are taken from the Lower Damgate Farm website:</p>

<h3>M1 FROM THE SOUTH</h3>

<p>Exit at Junction 24; pick up the A50 towards Derby, Uttoxeter and Stoke on Trent. Come off at the A515 Ashbourne exit. (See Ashbourne to Ilam direction below).</p>

<h3>FROM M42 SOUTH</h3>

<p>Come off at Junction 9 of M42 (Litchfield) pick up A442 past the Belfry Golf course then A38. Stay on the A38 to Barton under Needwood. (The new M6 Toll Road is now finished this parallels the above route. If you do take the toll go past Litchfield then come off on the A38).</p>

<p>From the A38 Come off at Barton-Under-Needwood, Go through Barton-U-Needwood. One mile after the village take a right turn, signposted to Rangemore. On this turning there is an old pub that has been turned into an Indian restaurant.</p>

<p>After approx 4 miles you come to a roundabout, go straight across the roundabout keeping the Garage on your left.</p>

<p>After approx 2 miles turn right at the crossroads onto the A515. Stay on this road going through Draycott in the Clay (mind the speed cameras) straight across the next roundabout and carry on this road (over a level crossing) until you get to the major roundabout on the A50. Turn left onto the A50 then half a mile take the next exit signposted Ashbourne, this takes you back onto the A515 to Ashbourne again.</p>

<h3>ASHBOURNE TO STANSHOPE/ILAM</h3>

<p>At the A52/ A515 roundabout, take the A52 towards Leek and Mayfield. Go past the Duke of York Filling station and pub on your right and over the river Dove. As the road goes uphill you will see a White Gate House immediately on the right. Take this right turn with caution just before the Gate house. (Signpost to Oakover &amp; Blore and Mappleton). Single-track road.</p>

<p>Stay on this road; go through Oakover Park (2 Cattle Grids) at T-junction turn left.</p>

<p>After travelling approx 2 miles up hill take a Right turn at the Crossroads which is just past Blore Hall, signpost Dovedale and Ilam. (Spectacular views across Dovedale and Ilam from here).</p>

<p>Go over the bridge at Ilam, through the village past the Hall entrance on your left and the School on your right, stay on this road (signposted Wetton/Stanshope) and go up a very steep hill for approx 2 miles. You will see two farms directly opposite from each other with a large sycamore tree outside. Our farm is on your right with a sign outside the gate, you will see Cedric the sheep – If you get to Stanshope you have gone too far!</p>

<h3>M1 FROM THE NORTH</h3>

<p>Junction 29, Chesterfield. In Chesterfield pick up directions for Matlock (A632).</p>

<p>After approx 4 miles out of the town at the top of a very long and steep hill turn Right (Signpost - Darley Dale) At Darley Dale T Junction turn right onto the A6, then immediately left. Go through villages of Wensley and Winster. In Winster turn left at the end of the high street. (No signposts) Go up the hill 300 Yards then straight across at the jagged crossroads. Stay on this road approx 3 miles turn. At T Junction turn Right though it looks as though you are going straight on. Stay on this road until you get to Newhaven and the A515. (Buxton to Ashbourne road) Turn left south to Ashbourne.</p>

<p>After approx 4 miles, Turn right opposite Alsop Car Park on the Tissington Trail, (no signpost though you are heading for Alstonefield) then ½ mile right again at the T-junction.</p>

<p>Go over the River Dove; Turn left signposted Milldale follow the road through Milldale and after approx 1.5 miles you will get to the Watts Russell Pub. Turn left after pub then immediately left again (signpost Ilam) after approx 1 mile you get to Stanshope, and then a further ¾ mile and you will find the property and barns on your left with a big Sycamore tree outside the gates. You will see Cedric the sheep sign at the gate – If you get to Ilam you have gone too far!</p>
