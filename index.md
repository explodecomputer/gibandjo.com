    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>The wedding will take place at <a href="http://www.damgate.com">Lower Damgate Farm</a> in Ilam in the Peak District. It is at least 1.5 hours' drive from Manchester, but allow longer as parts of the journey are along rather narrow and windy single track roads, full of trickery and sheep. Directions can be found <a href="http://www.damgate.com/directions.php">here</a>, and for more information, including where you can find accommodation, click <a href="/location/">here</a>.</p>
