				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p>Following months of discussion ("What even <em>is</em> marriage?") and planning ("What do you actually <em>do</em> at a Jewish-Muslim wedding?"), we hereby declare that we got married. The marriage was executed using a modest (by Pakistani standards) / lavish (by American standards) three-stage strategy, which included a civil ceremony in Bristol, a mehndi in Manchester, and a thing in a barn in the Peak District. Each event was made possible through the super-human efforts, wisdom, love, and dedication of some very special people. We were extremely touched by all of you who were so kind to honour us with your attendance: our friends, our family, people who we knew, people whose existence we were dimly aware of, and Taj's wife's grandmother. It was a wonderful time, we will remember it always. Thank you!</p>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Marriage is a near ubiquitous human concept but a highly heterogeneous human tradition. Understanding its place and meaning in the 21st century cosmopolitan West is non-trivial, and up until the end of 2013 we were quite content to regard it as a <em>theoretical problem</em>. However, at around that point shit started getting serious which forced us to elevate it to the status of <em>practical challenge</em>.</p>

					<p>So what happened next was that we spent a huge amount of energy thinking, while everyone around us spent a huge amount of energy getting stuff done. It turned out that though thinking is important, getting stuff done is pretty crucial. We attribute the smooth running of the wedding to the act of getting stuff done.</p>

					<p></p>



					<h2>Methods and Results</h2>

					<h3>Civil ceremony</h3>

					<p>Preparations for the civil ceremony were simple. We booked the registry office in Bristol for 20th September 2014. It was required that we underwent a pre-marriage interview some weeks prior to the event, which involved trying to convince a suspicious lady that the wedding wasn't being performed under duress. Which of us was suspected of being the perpetrator of the alleged criminal action was never specified. Once she was satisfied that all was well she asked us to fill out a customer feedback form, in which we suggested that she try to be less suspicious.</p>

					<p>Jo's parents arrived from the US, journeyed to Birmingham and travelled from here to Bristol by canal boat. Her Uncle David and Aunts Maggie and Margaret arrived by more conventional means. Derek and Anna came from Oxford and Sandra hopped in from London to stand in for sister Liz and family. Gib's parents, brother, sister, Khala Begum and cousins Adiba and Baji piled into a minivan and made the journey to Bristol from Manchester.</p>

					<p>It was a pleasant autumnal day and most of the party walked to the registry office in time for a 9am ceremony. The registrant introduced the bride and groom, and said some pleasant secular things. On a number of occasions she had to pronounce the bride's name and the groom's name. On each occasion she managed to find a new incorrect pronunciation. Half an hour into the ceremony attendants were impressed and astonished that she was still finding new variants in the pronunciation of the names 'Gibran Hemani' and 'Josephine Grobstein Walker'. We have dubbed the set of pronunciation variations the "Gib and Jo permutations".</p>

					<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Book date for civil ceremony</p>
					<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Assuage the suspicions of the civil servant conducting the pre-marriage checks by convincing her that the marriage is not taking place under duress. We did this by trying to act trustworthy.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find suitable attire. Preferably in good time, but last minute is fine. A good tie is crucial.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Suppress laughter during the ceremony when the celebrant manages to pronounce the names Gibran Hemani and Josephine Grobstein Walker differently each time she has to mention them.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The register is a permanent record of the wedding, so it's important that all the details are correct. When the registrar's assistant has written theCross out incorrect details and squeeze the right ones in if necessary. Correctness triumphs over neatness.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enjoy delicious vegan food with close family in your new home =]</p>

					<h3>Mehndi</h3>
					<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Construct a huge marquee over an apple tree in the backgarden. Decorate with colourful fabric and fairy lights.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Furnish with hand made floor cushions and then spend the evening waterproofing from the outside as the rain comes down hard. Ignore the snide remarks from the disgruntled chickens.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Invite dozens of people to smear turmuric paste over the faces of the bride and groom. Feed them berries. Eat delicious vegan Indian food</p>
					<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Henna. Lots of Henna.</p>

					<h3>Wedding</h3>

					<p class="bottom-buffer">Here we compare and contrast the marriage advice provided at the Islamic Niqah ceremony and the Reconstructionist Jewish Aufruf ceremony. Dr Taj delivered a concise and easy to remember set of words on which to meditate the manners and attitudes towards marriage. He began with words beginning with the letter 'T', detailed in Table 1.</p>

					<h3 style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">Table 1: The six T's of marriage</h3>
					<table class="table table-striped" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th style="text-align: center;">Word count</th>
								<th style="text-align: center;">First letter of the word</th>
								<th style="text-align: center;">The word</th>

								<td style="text-align: center;">T</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">Touching</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p class="top-buffer bottom-buffer">These were then supplemented with a set of ingredients that constitute a successful marriage. They began with the letter 'L' (Table 2).</p>

					<h3 class="top-buffer" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">Table 2: The three L's of marriage</h3>
					<table class="table table-striped" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th style="text-align: center;">Word count</th>
								<th style="text-align: center;">First letter of the word</th>
								<th style="text-align: center;">The word</th>

								<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">L</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">Love</td>

							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td style="text-align: center;">3</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">L</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">Laughter</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p class="top-buffer bottom-buffer">Finally Dr Taj bestowed three blessings upon us, which all conveniently began with the letter 'H'. See Table 3.</p>
