			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>Following months of discussion ("What even <em>is</em> marriage?") and planning ("What do you actually <em>do</em> at a Jewish-Muslim wedding?"), we hereby declare that we got married. The marriage was executed using a modest (by Pakistani standards) / lavish (by American standards) three-stage strategy, which included a civil ceremony in Bristol, a mehndi in Manchester, and a thing in a barn in the Peak District. Each event was made possible through the super-human efforts, wisdom, love, and dedication of some very special people. We were extremely touched by all of you who were so kind to honour us with your attendance: our friends, our family, people who we knew, people whose existence we were dimly aware of, and Taj's wife's grandmother. It was a wonderful time, we will remember it always. Thank you!</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Marriage is a near ubiquitous human concept but a highly heterogeneous human tradition. Understanding its place and meaning in the 21st century cosmopolitan West is non-trivial, and up until the end of 2013 we were quite content to regard it as a <em>theoretical problem</em>. However, at around that point shit started getting serious which forced us to elevate it to the status of <em>practical challenge</em>.</p>

		<p>So what happened next was that we spent a huge amount of energy thinking, while everyone around us spent a huge amount of energy getting stuff done. It turned out that though thinking is important, getting stuff done is pretty crucial. We attribute the smooth running of the wedding to the act of getting stuff done.</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>Civil ceremony</h3>
		<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Assuage the suspicions of the civil servant conducting the pre-marriage checks by convincing her that the marriage is not taking place under duress</p>
		<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find suitable attire. Preferably in good time, but last minute is fine. A good tie is crucial.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Fight the urge to burst into laughter during the ceremony when the celebrant manages to pronounce the names Gibran Hemani and Josephine Grobstein Walker differently each time she has to mention them.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The register is a permanent record of the wedding, so it's important that all the details are correct. Cross out incorrect details and squeeze the right ones in if necessary. Correctness triumphs over neatness.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enjoy delicious vegan food with close family in your new home =]</p>

		<h3>Mehndi</h3>
		<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Construct a huge marquee over an apple tree in the backgarden. Decorate with colourful fabric and fairy lights.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Furnish with hand made floor cushions and then spend the evening waterproofing from the outside as the rain comes down hard. Ignore the snide remarks from the disgruntled chickens.</p>
		<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Invite dozens of people to smear turmuric paste over the faces of the bride and groom. Feed them berries. Eat delicious vegan Indian food</p>
		<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Henna. Lots of Henna.</p>
