				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p>Following months of discussion ("What even <em>is</em> marriage?") and planning ("What do you actually <em>do</em> at a Jewish-Muslim wedding?"), we hereby declare that we got married. The marriage was executed using a modest (by Pakistani standards) / lavish (by American standards) four-stage strategy, which included a civil ceremony in Bristol, a mehndi in Manchester, and a thing in a barn in the Peak District, and a party in Montclair. Each event was made possible through the super-human efforts, wisdom, love, and dedication of some very special people. We were extremely touched by all of you who were so kind to honour us with your attendance: our friends, our family, people who we knew, people whose existence we were dimly aware of, and Taj's wife's grandmother. It was a wonderful time, we will remember it always. Thank you!</p>

					<h2 class="top-buffer">Introduction</h2>
					<p>Marriage is a near ubiquitous human concept but a highly heterogeneous human tradition. Understanding its place and meaning in the 21st century cosmopolitan West is non-trivial, and up until the end of 2013 we were quite content to regard it as a <em>theoretical problem</em>. However, at around that point things started getting serious which forced us to elevate it to the status of <em>practical challenge</em>.</p>

					<p>The practical challenge of assembling any wedding is daunting, but given the cultural maelstrom in which we found ourselves it seemed particularly insurmountable. But as we show through empirical findings there do exist tractable solutions, provided that certain conditions are met, which we detail below.</p>

					<p>First, you need finances. Alarming amounts of finances. Our parents took care of almost all of the financial aspects of the wedding and were astonishingly relaxed about the whole situation. They were brilliant and we are extremely lucky.</p>

					<p>Second, you need physical labour. And help for getting stuff done was never in short supply. Many, many people dropped everything that was happening in their lives, gritted their teeth, and did stuff for us without any hesitation. It was like having an army of wedding soldiers to hand. A kind of wedding army, that shows up and ruthlessly creates weddings and then leaves, efficient and precise with a reasonable exit strategy. They were brilliant and we are extremely lucky.</p>

					<p>A third important ingredient is creativity, planning and wisdom, which we term 'creplandom'. Outsourcing this to more capable members of the team was absolutely key, and the result was that we somehow realised a pretty plausible culturally heterogeneous wedding. They were brilliant and we are extremely lucky.</p>

					<p>Finally, the most important thing of all was love and acceptance. Our parents, families and friends have supported us, encouraged us and celebrated us in ways that are truly humbling. They are brilliant and we are extraordinarily lucky.</p>


					<h2 class="top-buffer">Methods and Results</h2>

					<h3>Civil ceremony</h3>

					<p>Preparations for the civil ceremony were simple. We booked the registry office in Bristol for 20th September 2014. It was required that we underwent a pre-marriage interview some weeks prior to the event, which involved trying to convince a suspicious lady that the wedding wasn't being performed under duress. Which of us was suspected of being the perpetrator of the alleged criminal action was never specified. Once she was satisfied that all was well she asked us to fill out a customer feedback form, in which we suggested that she try to be less suspicious in future.</p>

					<p>Jo's parents arrived from the US, journeyed to Birmingham and travelled from here to Bristol by canal boat. Her Uncle David and Aunts Maggie and Margaret arrived by more conventional means. Derek and Anna came from Oxford and Sandra hopped in from London to stand in for sister Liz and family. Gib's parents, brother, sister, Khala Begum and cousins Adiba and Baji piled into a minivan and made the journey to Bristol from Manchester.</p>

					<p>It was a pleasant autumnal day and most of the party walked to the registry office in time for an ungodly 09:00 ceremony. The registrant introduced the bride and groom, and said some pleasant secular things. As might be expected for a ceremony of this ilk it is required that the names of the bride and groom be spoken out loud from time to time, so as to personalise the event and specify who is being married with whom. Remarkably, each time such moment occurred the registrant managed to find a new incorrect pronunciation of our names. Half an hour into the ceremony attendants were impressed and astonished that she had the creativity to continue finding new variants in the pronunciation of the names 'Gibran Hemani' and 'Josephine Grobstein Walker'. We managed to not giggle too much and we applaud her for excellent preparation. Except for the part where they still had our old address and had to cross it out and scribble in the new one in the official marriage register. Someday in the future, someone will look up this auspicious record of our legal marriage and think we didn't even know our own address.</p>

					<p>Once we (or at least some people who have similar sounding names to us) were successfully married, everyone came back to our house for some delicious food catered by our favourite vegan leopard, The Spotless Leopard. Mmmmac and cheese.</p>


					<h3>Mehndi</h3>

					<p>Pakistani weddings often include a pre-wedding celebration known as the Mehndi. During this time henna is artistically applied to the bride's hands/arms and feet/legs over the course of several hours. There is often singing and dancing, but we pretty much skipped that part. </p>

					<p>Another ritual is for guests to approach the bride and groom, smear tumeric on their faces,  dab henna onto paan leaves on their open palms, and to feed them something sweet (pieces of fruit on this occasion).</p>


					<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Construct a huge marquee over an apple tree in the backgarden. Decorate with colourful fabric and fairy lights.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Furnish with hand made floor cushions and then spend the evening waterproofing from the outside as the rain comes down hard. Ignore the snide remarks from the disgruntled chickens.</p>
					<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Invite dozens of people to smear turmuric paste over the faces of the bride and groom, stuff their mouths with berries, and wave money destined for charity around their colourful mouths/faces. In this way we raised more than £200 for the Environmental Justice Foundation. </p>
					<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Henna. Lots of Henna. Several hours of henna. Eat delicious vegan Indian food without ruining henna. </p>

					<h3>Weddings and Blessings</h3>

					<p class="bottom-buffer">Here we compare and contrast the marriage advice provided at the Islamic Niqah ceremony and the Reconstructionist Jewish Aufruf ceremony. Dr Taj delivered a concise and easy to remember set of words on which to meditate the manners and attitudes towards marriage. He began with words beginning with the letter 'T', detailed in Table 1.</p>

					<h3 style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">Table 1: The six T's of marriage</h3>
					<table class="table table-striped" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">

								<td style="text-align: center;">T</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">Touching</td>

					</table>

					<p class="top-buffer bottom-buffer">These were then supplemented with a set of ingredients that constitute a successful marriage. They began with the letter 'L' (Table 2).</p>

					<h3 class="top-buffer" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">Table 2: The three L's of marriage</h3>
					<table class="table table-striped" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">

							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td style="text-align: center;">3</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">L</td>
								<td style="text-align: center;">Laughter</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p class="top-buffer bottom-buffer">Finally Dr Taj bestowed three blessings upon us, which all conveniently began with the letter 'H'. See Table 3.</p>

					<h3 class="top-buffer" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">Table 3: The three H's of marriage</h3>
					<table class="table table-striped" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto;">

					<p class="top-buffer">Reconstructionist Judaism has a lovely reconstructed view of marriage and we were honoured to receive such a nice blessing within the synagogue in Montclair. Normally the Aufruf blessing occurs before the wedding itself, but reconstructionism doesn't mind too much. We received the blessing with gratitude, but we can't exactly remember the details as we were quite hungry.</p>

					<p>And then we ate many bagels and had a party with Ethiopian food and three flavours of vegan cake: Cookies and Cream, Maple Walnut, and Raspberry Beret. Those of any religion would approve of such celebration.</p>


					<h2 class="top-buffer">Discussion</h2>
					<p>We would be absolutely the happiest to discuss anything further with any of you, if there is anything to discuss. Mostly we reiterate the gratefulness we feel to everyone who was a part of any part of our wedding process, and reach the conclusion that we are very lucky.</p>

					<p>We consider the wedding part of this marriage to be actually over, and future work will entail settling in to the marriage and life part of things. And determining on which date we should celebrate our anniversary.</p>
