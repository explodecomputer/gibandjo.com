## Lower Damgate Farm

The venue is comprised of a converted barn and stunning renovated cottages dating back to the 16th Century. The farm is situated in the Peak District and home, not just to humans, but rescued animals like chickens, goats and alpacas. 

The area has very little telephone network connectivity so it's likely that our mobile phones won't work. We are providing the farm's landline number just in case you wish to get into contact or need directions, however, please only use this number on the day of the wedding.

## DIRECTIONS

Please note that car parking space is limited, so if you plan to drive to the farm on Saturday please let us know so that we can make arrangements.

The best thing to do is to lookup the directions on Google. (Click on the "pin" in the center of the map above, then on "directions" and enter your starting point). **Print the directions** as the area around the farm has very little phone signal.

Using sat nav directions to the post code DE6 2AD may result in directions that take you to the tiny village of Stanshope. You will know you are there if you see a sign at a gateway for Stanshope Hall Bed and Breakfast.

Lower Damsgate Farm is 0.6 miles south of Stanshope Hall via Ilam Moor Road in the direction of Ilam. Look for two farms directly opposite from each other with a large sycamore tree outside. Lower Damsgate is on your left if coming from Stanshope, on the right if coming from Ilam. There is a sign outside the gate featuring Cedric the sheep.

In case it is of any help the following directions are taken from the Lower Damgate Farm website:

### M1 FROM THE SOUTH

Exit at Junction 24; pick up the A50 towards Derby, Uttoxeter and Stoke on Trent. Come off at the A515 Ashbourne exit. (See Ashbourne to Ilam direction below).

### FROM M42 SOUTH

Come off at Junction 9 of M42 (Litchfield) pick up A442 past the Belfry Golf course then A38. Stay on the A38 to Barton under Needwood. (The new M6 Toll Road is now finished this parallels the above route. If you do take the toll go past Litchfield then come off on the A38).

From the A38 Come off at Barton-Under-Needwood, Go through Barton-U-Needwood. One mile after the village take a right turn, signposted to Rangemore. On this turning there is an old pub that has been turned into an Indian restaurant.

After approx 4 miles you come to a roundabout, go straight across the roundabout keeping the Garage on your left.

After approx 2 miles turn right at the crossroads onto the A515. Stay on this road going through Draycott in the Clay (mind the speed cameras) straight across the next roundabout and carry on this road (over a level crossing) until you get to the major roundabout on the A50. Turn left onto the A50 then half a mile take the next exit signposted Ashbourne, this takes you back onto the A515 to Ashbourne again.

Go over the bridge at Ilam, through the village past the Hall entrance on your left and the School on your right, stay on this road (signposted Wetton/Stanshope) and go up a very steep hill for approx 2 miles. You will see two farms directly opposite from each other with a large sycamore tree outside. Our farm is on your right with a sign outside the gate, you will see Cedric the sheep – If you get to Stanshope you have gone too far!
