We often reflect on how lucky we are in life, in large part because of the fortune of having wonderful supportive families who are always there for us, and the privilege of coming from stable countries with relative freedom and opportunity.

We support the work of the [Environmental Justice Foundation](https://www.ejfoundation.org), which is a UK based environmental and human rights charity that empowers communities in the developing world to protect their own environment. If you were interested in giving us a wedding gift then perhaps you could donate that money to this charity via the link below? Alternatively, any gift that you give to us would be hugely, hugely appreciated.

## ONE LAST THING...

We would like to put together a proper analogue photo album for our new home. If you have any photographs of us (Gib and/or Jo and/or you and/or scenic backgrounds) that you'd like to share then please bring them along or send them to explodecomputer@gmail.com or jogwalker@gmail.com.
