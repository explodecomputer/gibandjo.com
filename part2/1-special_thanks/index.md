		<img src="/img/gib_parents.jpg">
		<p class="caption righttext">Gib's parents on their wedding day. Mum assures me that her look of devastation was purely in accordance with tradition.</p>

		<p>If we were to attempt to quantify the amount that you have done for us the units of measurement would probably be in metric tons and we simply don’t have the equipment to do it. Instead, we’d just like to write a couple of anecdotes here to give the world a flavour of how fantastic you have been.</p>

		<p><u>Anecdote number one:</u> At some point we had the idea that it would be nice to have the Niqah underneath a Jewish Chuppah and we mentioned in passing to Gib’s Dad that it could be a fun way to combine the different religions. Then we stopped thinking about it and continued trying to ignore the whole thing for a little bit longer. No less than two days later we received a picture from Noor of a Chuppah in their backgarden! Gib’s Dad had googled what one looked like and went about building one for the ceremony.</p>

		<p><u>Anecdote number two:</u> Did you know that Gib’s Mum sewed all 16 table runners and all 102 chair sashes by hand? Mostly in the small hours of the morning. Time was kind of running out (our fault) and one day she just said she was going to do it. And then they were done.</p>

		<p>You have been unreservedly accepting and inclusive, and you made this happen through back-breaking toil. And lots of love. And so much money. Thank you. How do you say thank you to that? We don’t know, it’s too much. Thank you.</p>
