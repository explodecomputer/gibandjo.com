		<p>Gibran's father, Bashir, was born in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania to parents of Indian origin. After finishing school he accepted a scholarship to come to England to study engineering in Bradford. While living here he worked in engineering and was a keen cricketer, and was also successful in regional badminton tournaments.</p>

		<p>Rukhsana, Gibran's mother, was born in Karachi, Pakistan, where she obtained a degree in Arts. She moved to England in 1982, and she was introduced to Bashir through her sister, Arzoo, who was already living in Bradford at the time, and soon after they were married they moved to Manchester where they have lived ever since.</p>

		<p>After completing his MBA Bashir worked in engineering and management consultancy all over the UK and Europe, most recently specialising in project management in IT and pharmaceuticals. Last year he took a well earned retirement, and now occupies his time looking after his chickens and bees, experimenting in the kitchen, and enjoying the Good Life. </p>

		<p>Rukhsana worked as a seamstress from an early age to help provide for her family in Pakistan while she was growing up, and when she moved to England she continued this line of work, providing soft furnishings for private clients. She has also worked as a carer in a nursing home, as an auxiliary nurse, and having obtained an MA in psychology, social work and education from the University of Manchester, she is now a fully accredited therapeutic counsellor and manager of the Roby Counselling Service in Manchester. Rukhsana also used to play badminton but mostly in the backgarden using the washing line as a net.</p>

		<p>Bash and Rukhsana have two other children, Arman and Noor-ul-ann. Arman has a Bachelors and a Masters degree in law from the Nottingham Law School where he specialised in intellectual property in pharmaceuticals in developing countries. He is currently working as a paralegal in a law firm in Manchester. Arman is amazing at bass guitar. He is also skeptical that humans are capable of altruism, which is curious because he is certainly capable of it himself. Perhaps this is his way of telling us he is not human? We're on to you Mani!</p>

		<p>It is said that when Noor was a baby she would only be sick when her father was carrying her. Her father wears this as a badge of honour (figuratively speaking, he is all for good hygiene). Noor grew up with two big brothers who fed her a wholesome diet of heavy metal and Calvin and Hobbes, but it didn't take long for her to find her own style. She is currently studying English Literature at the University of York. Noor has a wonderful artistic flair, and has been an amazing help with planning the wedding.</p>

		<p>Rukhsana's eldest sister, Arzoo, also lives in Manchester with her younger daughter, Adiba. Arzoo has two daughters and two sons. Her elder daughter, Shehla Naqvi, has been a constant presence and role model for Gibran, Arman and Noor. She lives in Newcastle where she practices psychotherapy and manages Concept Eye Clinic.</p>

		<h2>Family background</h2>

		<p>Rukhsana's father, Syed Jalal Uddin Khayyam ul Hindh Haider Dehalvi, was of Persian origin and lived and worked in Delhi as a poet. He was the poet laureate of India prior to Partition, after which time he moved to Karachi, Pakistan. He died 20 days before Rukhsana was born. Rukhsana's mother, Amtum Nabi Haider, worked as an embroiderer and also as a welfare worker helping to empower socially deprived women through unions and cottage industries. She successfully raised her five children without re-marrying, and lives in Karachi with her son and close by to two of her daughters.</p>

		<p>Bashir's father, Ghulam Hussain Haji Hemani, was one of ten sons born to Haji Hemani in India. He moved to Tanzania where he owned a second hand bookshop in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania where he was an intellectual and Islamic scholar. He was the first person to translate the Quran into an African language (Swahili). Bashir's mother, Zubeda Razak Hemani, was born in a farm outside Dar. She was the daughter of a hakeem (herbal based healer) and became one herself. She raised nine children.</p>
