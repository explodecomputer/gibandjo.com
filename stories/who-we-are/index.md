		<p class="caption righttext">Gib hates smiling in pictures. This makes life difficult sometimes, but I am learning to live with it.</p>

		<p class="righttext">Gib has led me to believe that he was born on a Tuesday. After that, he wore glasses but now he doesn't need them anymore. He grew up on a nice cul-de-sac in Urmston, and then a main road in Urmston, where he terrorized the neighborhood on his roller blades. To this day, some of the rails that he ground (grinded?) can still be seen. This led to much dislocation of shoulders. He also played a lot of football, on almost every field in Manchester. </p>

		<p class="righttext">At some point, he had to take a test and this meant he could go to Urmston Grammar School, and he had to do GCSEs and A levels which are all British schooling things that I don't understand, but it meant he had to decide what to study pretty early on. He did impressively well in his A levels and went on to study genetics at the University of Nottingham, where for his final year project he looked at some genes in archaea (microorganisms).</p>

		<p class="righttext">For a year after finishing university, Gib worked as a project manager at a company that provides bespoke temperature controlled storage containers to people that need that kind of thing. He had a motorbike which he reminisces about often, and he took a carpentry class but he has not yet demonstrated any carpentry skills to me. He also did a lot of film photography and set up a darkroom in the bathroom of his flat. I think Gib is so into black and white photography and genetics because he is color-blind. Because my mother's sister is a carrier of the color blindness allele, there is a decent chance that if Gib and I have a daughter she would be color blind. Unfortunately I can't figure out the exact probability at this point, but I'll ask Gib to help me later. </p>

		<p class="righttext">In 2007, Gib moved to Edinburgh to do a PhD in Genetics at the Roslin Institute. He also spent some time eating food that came from within 100 miles of Edinburgh, which meant mostly oats and nettles. Three years later, after what I can only assume was much toiling, I showed up and tried to distract him from writing up his PhD. In the end my distractions didn't work and Gib received a thesis prize and got hired to work with the best people in his field who are based in Brisbane, Australia. Over two years of extreme long distance, Gib really perfected his ability to use Skype while also playing online chess. In January 2014, he moved to Bristol to start a new job and now we only talk on Skype when we want to reminisce.</p>

		<h2>ABOUT THE BRIDE (BY THE GROOM)</h2>
		<img src="/img/jo_beach.jpg">
		<p class="caption">I like this picture of Jo, it is a good representation of how we like to spend our time - windswept and smiling on rocks near the sea.</p>

		<p>I do not know if she ever went to primary school (let's assume that she did), but I am led to believe that she did attend secondary school at Montclair High. Here she played trumpet in something called "the band". Though I have come to understand that this is something significant, what that significance actually is still eludes me. She also did lots of maths. Sometimes she took extra classes at a nearby university. This means she has either very high intelligence, or very low intelligence.</p>

		<p>Not long afterwards, Jo left Montclair and attended Princeton University. Here she "majored" in Ecology and Evolutionary biology, and "minored" in African studies and Environmental studies. Whatever that means. She also manufactured time to study Arabic. She played in "the band" here too, but it was a different band. I once asked her if 'the band' was like a terrorist organisation, and there were different cells in different places, but she said, "No, not really". Hmm. Suspicious. Quite some time after we met, one of her friends told me she finished top of her department at Princeton. You kept that one quiet Jo!</p>

		<p>Then she went and did some work in Kenya, and then she did some research in South Africa, and she made it all the way to Australia to do some more research there too. She finally started a PhD in Bristol where she setup field work in Botswana and did more research in Australia. </p>

		<p>Jo is interested in everything. This makes for endless conversation. There are some aspects of her character that are lacking though. For example, she simply cannot peel oranges. Even though orange is her favourite colour. And if she sees a dog, a jar of tahini, or some pickles, she will walk towards it without hesitation, which means she can't go outside unsupervised.</p>
