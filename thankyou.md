	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Following months of discussion ("What even <em>is</em> marriage?") and planning ("What do you actually <em>do</em> at a Jewish-Muslim English-American wedding?"), we hereby declare that we got married. The marriage was executed using a modest three-stage strategy, including a civil ceremony in Bristol, a mehndi in Manchester, and a thing in a barn in the Peak District. Each stage was made possible through the super-human efforts, wisdom, love, and dedication of some very <a href="/special_people/">Special people</a>. We were extremely touched by those who were so kind to honour us with their presence: our friends, our family, people who we knew, people whose existence we were dimly aware of, and Taj's wife's grandmother. It was a wonderful time, thank you!</p>
